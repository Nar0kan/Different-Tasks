In this folder i used to practice with Jinja2 package.
The code is particulary taken from https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA0M1Bcd0w8wfmtElObQrBbZjY6XeA06U
where the author is clearly describing all of basic functionality that Jinja2 have on Rusian language.
Also some material is taken from https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#builtin-filters
and other sources.
Now about the files.
Example_1.py was my introduction to Template, render and {{}} things.
Example_2.py and example2.1.htm|example2.2.htm were implementing templates with some html code.
Example_3.py is about for and if statements in jinja2.
Example_4.py is based on learning a few built-in filters.
Example_5.py and templates folder are connected via HTML. Python file using jinja to change and
add new features to index.htm and page.htm files.
