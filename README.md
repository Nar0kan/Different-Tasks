# Different-Tasks
Folders brief info:
    Chekio - contain tasks i made from chekio python website.
    Jinja2Prictice - I used to practice for a little bit with jinja2 package as my future web dev tool.
    OOP - in few words it's Object Oriented Programming in python exercises and lessons I've completed.
    OtherSources - don't ask me, ask google.
    RegEx - re Python package that is used for operations with templates. Few tasks were done, but only for now.
    My_Web_App - it's my web app with gallery and some backend features that I'll add as soon as possible.

Soo, if you want My_Web_App to start you need previously download some packages: pip, django, dotenv.
Also consider to create a file .git in Django_2022/cloudwirefire/cloudwirefire/ folder and match the variable
SECRET_KEY to your Django secret key. BTW forgot to remove it in one of my commits before lol.
Anyway you can also just enter this SECRET_KEY in settings.py at the same directory.



Cool, let's move on.
